# **Capstone Project**: Salifort Motors Employee Retention 


## Project Overview:
For the capstone project at Salifort Motors, I analyzed employee survey data to identify factors influencing turnover and built a predictive model to forecast employee departure. The objective was to assist Salifort Motors in increasing retention rates, improving job satisfaction, and reducing recruitment costs. Leveraging Python for model building and data analysis, I deployed various machine learning models and communicated key insights to stakeholders.


## About Salifort Motors:
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer with a global workforce of over 100,000 employees. The company specializes in researching, designing, constructing, validating, and distributing electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort Motors is known for its end-to-end vertical integration model and leadership in the alternative energy and automobile sectors.


## Business Case:
Salifort Motors was experiencing a high turnover rate among its employees, which concerned the senior leadership team due to its impact on corporate culture, employee success, and financial costs. They need a predictive model that can forecast whether an employee will leave the company based on factors such as department, job title, number of projects, and average monthly hours. A successful model would enable Salifort Motors to better understand turnover drivers, implement targeted retention initiatives and improve overall employee satisfaction.


## Project Deliverables:
1. **Data Analysis:** Analyzed survey data to identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
2. **Model Development:** Built and evaluated a predictive model using Python. Chose between logistic regression or machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, or XGBoost.
3. **Executive Summary:** Presented findings and recommendations to the senior leadership team through an executive summary. Summarized key insights, model performance, and suggested strategies for increasing employee retention.


## Importance:
This capstone project provided valuable experience in data analysis and model building, showcasing my ability to leverage Python for predictive analytics and communicate insights to stakeholders. By addressing the employee retention challenge, Salifort Motors could enhance its organizational effectiveness and competitiveness in the market.
