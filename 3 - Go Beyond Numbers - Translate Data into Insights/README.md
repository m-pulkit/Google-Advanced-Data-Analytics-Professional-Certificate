# Go Beyond Numbers - Translate Data into Insights


## Overview 
This course emphasized transforming raw data into compelling stories and insights.


## Key Learnings
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Delved deep into EDA, learning a systematic process to explore, understand, and uncover hidden patterns within datasets.
- **Data Wrangling Wizardry:**
  - Honed skills in cleaning, transforming, and preparing messy data for analysis using Python libraries like Pandas.
- **Data Visualization Storytelling:**
  - Learned to create impactful data visualizations with tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn, effectively communicating insights through clear and informative charts and graphs.


## Bonus Skills
- To solidify my understanding, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world Lightning Strikes dataset.
- This EDA involved multiple visualizations like strike frequency across different regions. 
- Also it focused on potentially identifying correlations between lightning strikes and other factors.
- This hands-on exercise allowed me to apply the concepts learned in the course to a practical scenario, further solidifying my ability to extract insights from data.
- I learnt about how in some cases the missing or NA values can help in getting insights in the data and why they shouldn't be discarded right away. Instead the reasons why some particular values are missing should be explored."


## Conclusion
By completing this course, I can now:
- Ask the right questions of data: Approaching datasets with a strategic mindset to extract meaningful information.
- Transform data into stories: Translating complex data into clear and impactful narratives.
- Communicate insights effectively: Data visualizations are powerful tools for conveying findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
